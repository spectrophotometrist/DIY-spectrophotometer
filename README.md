# DIY spectrophotometer

The instrument for which this was built uses a Raspberry Pi Zero W to control a stepper motor via a driver on the GPIO pins

Data is acquired through a photodiode outputting an analog voltage, which the RPi reads through an ADC communicating over I2C

A desktop or laptop computer is used to control the RPi and to receive the data

The RPi must be free to scp files to the computer


led.py is a simple program on the RPi that turns on an external LED when the RPi is ready to be signed into by secure shell after reboot

photodiode.py is a simple program on the RPi that monitors the output voltage from the photodiode and presents it in a simple graphical form

spectrophotometer.py must be running on the RPi to use the spectrophotometer

spectrophotometer_control.py is run on the controlling computer to trigger the spectrophotometer to read a spectrum (or obtain a blank reading); after a spectrum has been obtained, it automatically creates an absorbance vs. motor position plot

spectrum_compare.py allows the user to select multiple spectra to open at once and compare them

Please feel free to use this "terrible python code" as the foundation for your own projects; I can't wait to see what you come up with!

Soli Deo Gloria!

5/29/26 UPDATE:
New versions of two scripts (spectrophotometer_control_lab.py and spectrophotometer_lab.py) have been added, which allow the computer to copy files from the Pi, even if the Pi cannot scp files directly to the computer (e.g. if the computer is managed by your organization, and you do not have admin privileges).
